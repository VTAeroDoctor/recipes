Ingredients:
 Cake:
 - 1/2 cup shortening
 - 1-1/2 cups white sugar
 - 2 eggs
 - 2 tbsp cocoa
 - 4 tbsp red food coloring
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract
 - 1 cup buttermilk
 - 2-1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
 - 1-1/2 tsp baking soda
 - 1 tbsp distilled white vinegar
 
 Icing:
 - 5 tbsp all-purpose flour
 - 1 cup milk
 - 1 cup white sugar
 - 1 cup butter, room temperature
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round pans.
 
 2. Beat shortening and 1 1/2 cups sugar until very light and fluffy. Add eggs and beat well.
 
 3. Make a paste of cocoa and red food coloring; add to creamed mixture. Mix salt, 1 teaspoon
    vanilla, and buttermilk together. Add the flour to the batter, alternating with the buttermilk
    mixture, mixing just until incorporated. Mix soda and vinegar and gently fold into cake batter.
    Don't beat or stir the batter after this point.

 4. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted into the cake
    comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool cakes completely on wire rack.

 5. To Make Icing: Cook 5 tablespoons flour and milk over low heat till thick, stirring constantly.
    Let cool completely! While mixture is cooling, beat 1 cup sugar, butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla
    until light and fluffy. Add cooled flour mixture and beat until frosting is a good spreading
    consistency. Frost cake layers when completely cool.
